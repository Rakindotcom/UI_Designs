 <h1>My UI Designs</h1>

  <p>Hello, I’m Rakin Al Shahriar, a UI/UX designer and aspiring web developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have been creating UI/UX designs for quite a long time and have worked on numerous projects. Previously, I used Adobe XD, which limited my ability to share files online. However, I’ve recently shifted to Figma and created several UI designs, which you can see below:</p>
